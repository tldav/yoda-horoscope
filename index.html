						<!-- Millenials and baby boomers alike have taken an interest
						in the stars as esoteric guiding lights as they seek
						solace and security in a world that seems more ephemeral
						and temporary than ever before. <br /><br />Furthermore,
						it has long been known that modern English syntax has
						been engineered to code and hide fundamental truths that
						can and should be conveyed through the spoken and
						written word. This mal-engineering has no doubt been the
						work of Webster and his affiliates, English teachers.
						<br /><br /><br />An alternative to this malicious and
						oppressive syntax was introduced to the public in 1980
						when the Empire struck back, and Yoda helped turn our
						dear SkyWalker, Luke, from a boy into a man. Had Yoda
						simply said "do you judge me by my size" instead of
						"judge me by my size do you" Luke may never have lifted
						that starship out of the muck. And then be where, would
						we? <br /><br /><br />Our application, the YodaScope,
						unlocks the wisdom of western astrology using the syntax
						of the Yoda.
